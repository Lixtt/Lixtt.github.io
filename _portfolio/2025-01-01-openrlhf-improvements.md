- **lightRLHF Development**: Developing lightRLHF as a lightweight version based on openRLHF improvements
- **Algorithm Improvements**: Developing improved RLHF algorithms for better training efficiency
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimizing training speed and resource utilization
- **Lightweight Design**: Creating a more efficient and accessible RLHF framework

## Technologies

- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
- openRLHF Framework
- lightRLHF Framework
- PyTorch
- Large Language Model Training
- Distributed Training

## Impact

The improvements significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of RLHF-based training for large language models. The lightRLHF variant makes RLHF training more accessible by reducing computational requirements while maintaining high performance, enabling faster iteration and lower resource costs.
