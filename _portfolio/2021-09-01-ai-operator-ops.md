## Overview

During my tenure at Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., I developed AI-powered automation systems for operator network operations. This project focused on automating routine network management tasks, monitoring, and optimization processes.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Network Monitoring**: Implemented AI models for real-time network health monitoring and anomaly detection
- **Automated Operations**: Developed automated workflows for common network operations tasks
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Built predictive models to identify potential network issues before they occur
- **Resource Optimization**: Created algorithms for intelligent resource allocation and network optimization

## Technologies

- Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- Deep Learning
- Network Management Systems
- Automation Frameworks
- Python, Shell Scripting

## Impact

The system significantly reduced manual intervention in network operations, improved response times to network issues, and enhanced overall network reliability and efficiency.
