## Overview

This project involved developing AI systems to automatically detect, diagnose, and handle base station errors in telecommunications networks. The system processes error logs, identifies root causes, and suggests or implements automated fixes.

## Key Features

- **Error Detection**: Real-time monitoring and detection of base station errors from log data
- **Intelligent Diagnosis**: AI models for root cause analysis and error classification
- **Automated Resolution**: Automated error handling and recovery procedures
- **Learning System**: Continuous learning from historical error patterns and resolutions

## Technologies

- Natural Language Processing (for log analysis)
- Machine Learning Classification
- Anomaly Detection
- Automated Decision Systems
- Python, Network Protocols

## Impact

The system dramatically reduced base station downtime, improved error resolution times, and decreased maintenance costs through proactive error handling and automated recovery.
