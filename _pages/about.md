## About Me

I am a researcher at Shanghai AI Lab, focusing on cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence and machine learning. My current research interests include:

- **Large Language Model Post-training**: Developing efficient methods for fine-tuning and post-training large language models
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Exploring reinforcement learning techniques for training intelligent agents
- **Multi-agent Systems**: Investigating coordination and collaboration mechanisms in multi-agent environments
- **Multimodal AI**: Working on integrating vision and language in multimodal large language models (MLLM)
- **Embodied AI**: Previously worked on embodied intelligence, including text-to-scene generation and robotic applications

## Research Projects

My research spans several exciting areas:

### Multi-agent Research Assistant
Developing intelligent multi-agent systems for research assistance, enabling collaborative problem-solving among multiple AI agents.

### Multimodal Large Language Models
Working on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods for improving reasoning capabilities in multimodal settings.

### Reinforcement Learning Framework Integration
Integrating and improving reinforcement learning frameworks including veRL, openRLHF, and slime, with algorithm enhancements for better training efficiency and performance.

### Automated Evaluation Framework
Improving automated evaluation frameworks based on lmms-eval for comprehensive assessment of multimodal and language models.

### Research Tools & Infrastructure
Building MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for research workflows, including arXiv integration and other research tools.

### Text-to-Scene Generation
Previous work on generating 3D scenes from natural language descriptions, bridging the gap between language understanding and 3D scene representation.
